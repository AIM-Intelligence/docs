## Get started in three steps

Set up your first AIM Monitor project and start tracking AI model interactions.

### Step 1: Create Organization and Project

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="building" title="Create your organization">
    1. Navigate to the [Organizations](https://monitor.aim-intelligence.com) page
    2. Click "Create Organization"
    3. Enter your organization name
    4. Confirm creation
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="folder" title="Create your first project">
    1. Within your organization, click "Create Project"
    2. Enter a project name
    3. Select your environment (default, production, staging, etc.)
    4. Copy your Project API Key - you'll need this in the next step

    <Tip>Keep your API key secure and never commit it to version control.</Tip>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 2: Send Your First Trace

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="code" title="Using the API">
    Send a trace to AIM Monitor using a simple API call:

    ```bash
    curl -X POST https://api.aim-intelligence.com/v1/traces \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "name": "chat-completion",
        "input": "What is AI monitoring?",
        "output": "AI monitoring is...",
        "metadata": {
          "model": "gpt-4",
          "user_id": "user123"
        }
      }'
    ```

    <Tip>Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with the API key from Step 1.</Tip>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 3: View Your Data

<Accordion icon="chart-line" title="Explore your dashboard">
  1. Navigate to your project dashboard
  2. View your first trace in the [Tracing](/observability/tracing) table
  3. Explore metrics, costs, and performance data
  4. Set up filters to analyze specific data

  <Tip>Data typically appears within seconds of being sent.</Tip>
</Accordion>
